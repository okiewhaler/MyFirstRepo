I'm a blub blub fish with a blub blub face and I spread my dreary-wearies all over the place.

I'm a kiss kiss fish with a kiss kiss face and I spread my cheery cheeries all over the place.

I smooch and I smooch and I smooch!

My Mr. Fish with your cross-town frown
It's time to turn that scowl upside down.

Hey Ms. Squid, its OK
There's nothing I can do 
I'm just that way
